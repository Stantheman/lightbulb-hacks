# lightbulb hacks

I started messing with my wifi light bulb and decided to see how far I could go.

As I started diving in, I found that a lot of people have covered this type of bulb in previous blog posts or github projects. I have successfully avoided reading those posts while digging in so I could learn some stuff on my own.

Nothing super intense here. Any code I write in this project is MIT licensed unless otherwise specified. I removed the repo-wide file since I'm keeping track of the PDFs I got from the manufacturer
